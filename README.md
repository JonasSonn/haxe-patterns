# haxe-patterns
A simple haxe library to help you utilize common design patterns

Inspiration: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns

### Available pattern (so far)
 
- Strategy

### For the interested
  
- New design pattern will be added at random times.
- If you have suggestion or want to add a pattern, let me know
- It can be somewhat tricky generalizing a pattern. Although, haxe type system is very helpful though. So I'm not sure if I can add all pattern successfully. Unless, I start macroing around (maybe).
- Very often you need to extend/implement classes for patterns. This is (and should) be described for each pattern.
- I usually use the example from refactoring.guru in the unit tests.
